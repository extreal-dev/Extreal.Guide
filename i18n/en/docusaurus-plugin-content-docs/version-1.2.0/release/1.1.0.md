## Upgrade guide {#upgrade-guide}

Please update the module versions.

Since there are changes that affect backward compatibility, please check the following and respond to the applicable applications.

### Extreal.Integration.Chat.Vivox

#### Applications affected by the change

Applications that meet at least one of the following conditions are affected.

- Timeout is specified in login (LoginAsync method of VivoxClient) or channel connection (ConnectAsync method of VivoxClient)
- Exception handling for TimeoutException in login or channel connection calls.

#### Change impact and how to respond

The method of detecting failure in login and channel connection has been changed from timeout to waiting for the processing result.
Since login and channel connection are asynchronous processing, we decided to round off processing at timeout in consideration of cases where the result is not returned, and to use event notifications separate from method calls to monitor the login and connection statuses.
After testing various cases with the addition of reconnection, we were able to confirm that there were no cases where the results of login and channel connection processing were not returned, so we made this change so that processing failures can be detected immediately.

The change impact is as follows.
- LoginAsync method of VivoxClient
  - Timeout can no longer be specified.
  - The exception sent when processing fails has been changed from TimeoutException to VivoxConnectionException.
- ConnectAsync method of VivoxClient
  - Timeout can no longer be specified.
  - The exception sent when processing fails has been changed from TimeoutException to VivoxConnectionException.

Please take the following actions.
- If you wish to realize a timeout, implement it on the caller side of each method.
- Please change the exception that was caught on processing failure of each method from TimeoutException to VivoxConnectionException.
