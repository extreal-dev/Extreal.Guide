# Introduction

Extreal is based on the know-how we have acquired through our product development.
Product development is a trial-and-error process in which experienced engineers apply new mechanisms, design principles, and libraries to improve productivity and quality, which increases the number of prerequisite skills and increases the learning cost for new participants.
Extreal, which incorporates the know-how acquired through such product development, has a similarly high learning cost.
In return, we believe that the team will be more productive if they acquire the skills necessary for Extreal.

Learning is provided in a hands-on manner so that participants can experience how to create applications that take advantage of Extreal's features.
If you are new to Extreal, please start learning from [Core](/learning/core).
All other Learning is based on the assumption that you have already learned Core.

The remainder of the Introduction shows the skills needed to utilize Extreal.
These skills are also prerequisite skills for implementing Learning.
We have combined these skills with resources we refer to in order to lower the cost of learning these skills as much as possible.
If you have any questions after trying Learning, please refer to the resources listed here for self-study.
